            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is essentially a system wherein a coder can track all the changes made to a file or set of files over any x amount of time. Version control systems are beneficial to coders because they allow us to revert files back to previous versions, thus allowing us to find any issues created along the way, or to pinpoint what and where problems are coming from. They also help with recovery when any files are corrupted and/or lost.  There are three different types of version control: local, centralized and distributed, and each one has a special purpose that makes it a valuable asset for anyone dealing with different versions of the same files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of version control system that differs from other VCSs in the way it processes the changes made to your files.  Other VCSs store every version and retain a copy of every single changed file after each change. Git, instead, takes micro screenshots every time you save. Git can be thought of as a tiny file system rather than a change tracker. Git also differs from other VCSs in that it operates locally (most operations don’t need information from external computers/sources) and it is very easy to pull up any changes made in between commits (saves in Git).</p>

                <span class="text-muted">How do you get a Git repository?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two different ways you can get a Git repository. Although both ways are very different, both will get you the repository you need. The first method pulls an existing project from a different location into Git. Using the directory comman “$ git init” you will create a Git repository skeleton and bring into Git the files you need. At this point you would perform your first commit and you would be ready to keep working. The other method is to clone an existing repository. With this method, you would use the command “$ git clone [insert url]” to create a duplicate copy of a repository that already exists.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">How do you record changes to your repository?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Whenever you perform “commits” you are recording the micro screenshots of changes made to your Git repository. Each file in your directory will be modified, unmodified, or staged, and your goal is to get it tracked and modified. Whenever you make any changes to any of your files, Git sees it as “modified” meaning you need to commit the changes you are trying to keep. You begin the process by checking the status of your files using the “$ git status” command.  This will tell you if you have a clean working directory (meaning there are no files to commit and no modified files. After you’ve determined what files you need to modify, you would follow a series of simple “$ git ___” commands for whichever status your file is in to get it committed, “screenshot,” and saved.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is a GitHub?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the Internet’s largest host for Git repositories. It is essentially a place for developers to host their Git codes and easily perform commands to code Git. It’s a very useful site and tool for developers to collaborate on projects with other developers around the world. A strikingly large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted by GitHub, making it the most prominent repository-hosting site. Some projects even use GitHub specifically as a tracking mechanism; they put their projects into GitHub to track issues, review their code, and host their Git coding, among other tools and uses. GitHub is a great tool to know how to use as you might end up using it if you find yourself using Git professionally.</p>
